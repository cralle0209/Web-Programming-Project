HTML:
The website opens up to ask which type of encryption you would like to use to encrypt your file with using three colored buttons. Upon clicking one of the buttons, you'll be asked to upload a file, no larger than 1mb in size to prevent crashing the website. After that, you'll be required to enter an encryption key. If the key is too small, the website will ask you to input a larger key. After that is done, depending on what encryption algorithm was used, the website will encrypt the content, which can be downloaded on the final page.

CSS:
The CSS styles each button and facilitates ease of movement between pages, while giving the webpage its black background to make it easier on the eyes.

Javascript:
The JavaScript functions within are designed to implement the functionality of the website. In the code, it encrypts for each algorithm using if statements. When the program passes through those statements, it encrypts the data files inserted using e.target.result to finalize the encryption.
