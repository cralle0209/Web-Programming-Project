HTML:
The website opens up to ask which type of encryption you would like to use to encrypt your file with in the form of three radio buttons: one for AES, one for DES, and one for Rabbit encryption. The user will be asked to upload a file with the upload button on the left side of the page. After clicking a button and uploading the file, the user can hit the submit button which will encrypt the file.

CSS:
The CSS centers the text and buttons in the middle of the webpage, while creating a light blue background color to make the webpage more appealing to look at.

Javascript:
The Javascript begins by implementing the DES level of encryption. As the file moves on, it will implement AES or Rabbit encryption based on which option the user chose on the HTML.
